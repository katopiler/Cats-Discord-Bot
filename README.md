# Cats-Discord-Bot
This project is for the code of my discord bot!

To use this bot, please just put the discord token of the bot in the index.js file, then run install.bat (windows) or install.sh (linux/macos) to install the required dependencies.
MAKE SHURE YOU HAVE NODEJS INSTALLED OR THIS WILL NOT WORK!
